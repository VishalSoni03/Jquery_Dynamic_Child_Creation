# Jquery_Dynamic_Child_Creation
Created For Study Purpose. It generates child elements according to number entered in the prompt. This can be extended to create a blog like websites or may be any other use.  As I have adjusted childs on random this is not suggested for Mobile Version or remove randomness in child creation.
